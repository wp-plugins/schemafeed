= How do I customize the schema properties at the bottom of the post? =

Most of the properties you can define is displayed at the bottom of a posting. There are two areas where you can control the look and feel.
Schema Settings controls the general structural template. Within that template, there are coding 
variables ( place holders ) shown within the brackets "[[" and "]]", these are replaced with the actual property names and values. The
visual aspect is controlled via the CSS file "style.css" located in the plugin folder "schemafeed/css/style.css". 
To edit, goto Plugins->SchemaFeed (Edit), then select the file "schemafeed/css/style.css".
